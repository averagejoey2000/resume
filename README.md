- ## About Me
-
- My principal characteristic is that I'm an Unlimited Tonnage 3rd Mate USCG Licensed Deck Officer. I also tutor, write, sing, act, and cook. Entertaining those passions has been an excellent source of personal growth, and I hope the skills I've learned can be useful in and out of the maritime industry.  
- I'm non-binary, genderfluid to be precise, and my pronouns change cyclically in phase with the moon. When the moon is 25%-75% illuminated, refer to me with (he/him) pronouns and masculine designations such as Mr. and Sir. Conversely, when the moon is 0-24% or 76-100%, (she/her), Ms., and Ma'am.
